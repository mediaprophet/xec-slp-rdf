# International Structure for Web Civics Incorporation

## Overview
The proposed structure establishes a Swiss cooperative, "Trust Factory," as the central entity in Geneva, Switzerland, leveraging the jurisdiction’s favorable cooperative laws and its role as a hub for international organizations. Trust Factory will oversee the creation and governance of a network of "Web Civics" entities across multiple jurisdictions, ensuring alignment with human rights principles and socioeconomic participation. The structure is designed to scale globally while maintaining ethical standards and operational integrity.

1. Central Entity: Trust Factory (Swiss Cooperative)

**Why a Swiss Cooperative?**

**Legal Framework:** Switzerland’s cooperative law (Articles 828–926 of the Swiss Code of Obligations) supports democratically controlled entities that balance economic and social goals, ideal for a mission-driven organization. Cooperatives are member-owned, with each member having one vote, aligning with democratic participation principles.
Geneva’s Advantages: Geneva hosts over 40 international organizations and 750 NGOs, offering a robust ecosystem for multilateral cooperation, human rights advocacy, and global governance.

**Tax and Regulatory Benefits:** Swiss cooperatives benefit from a favorable corporate regime, with potential tax exemptions for non-profit activities, and Geneva’s infrastructure supports international operations.

### Incorporation Steps for Trust Factory

**Draft Articles of Association:**
- **Define the cooperative’s purpose:** to curate and govern a global network of Web Civics entities, promoting human rights and socioeconomic participation through digital and civic infrastructure.
- **Specify membership criteria:** open to individuals, organizations, or regional Web Civics entities that commit to human rights principles (e.g., Universal Declaration of Human Rights).
- **Outline governance:** one member, one vote; a board of directors with explicit duties to advocate for human rights; mechanisms for transparency and accountability.

***Include provisions for hybrid/virtual meetings to facilitate global participation, as permitted under Swiss corporate law reforms (effective January 2023).***


**Register with the Commercial Register:**
- File the articles of association with the Geneva Commercial Register to obtain legal entity status.
- Pay required fees (approximately CHF 600–1,000, depending on capital).

**Capital Requirements:**
- No minimum capital is required for cooperatives, but members must contribute a nominal share (e.g., CHF 100–1,000) to ensure accessibility. Economic benefits are distributed based on participation, not capital invested.

**Tax and Compliance:**
- Register for VAT if applicable (threshold: CHF 100,000 annual turnover).
- Ensure compliance with Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) if financial services (e.g., trust management) are involved.

**Human Rights Advocacy Mechanisms:**
- Establish a Human Rights Committee within the board to oversee compliance with international human rights standards.
- Create a charter mandating advocacy for human rights in all operations, with annual reporting to members.
- Include clauses allowing the cooperative to exit jurisdictions or partnerships that violate human rights principles.

### Governance Structure

**Board of Directors:** Elected by members, with a mandate to advocate for human rights and ensure fair socioeconomic participation. At least one director should have expertise in international human rights law.

- **Membership:** Open to individuals, NGOs, and regional Web Civics entities meeting non-discriminatory criteria (e.g., commitment to human rights, transparency).
- **Decision-Making**: Democratic, with one vote per member. Virtual voting options to ensure global accessibility.
- **Transparency:** Annual reports on human rights advocacy, financials, and network activities, published publicly to align with Geneva’s multilateral ethos.

2. Web Civics: Regional Entities

**Purpose**
Web Civics entities are operational arms in various jurisdictions, responsible for implementing local projects that promote civic engagement, digital inclusion, and socioeconomic participation. These entities are linked to Trust Factory via a licensing or partnership agreement, ensuring alignment with the central mission.
Requirements for Regional Entities

**Jurisdictional Eligibility:**
Jurisdictions must demonstrate a legal and political environment supportive of human rights (e.g., adherence to international treaties like the ICCPR or ICESCR).
Ineligible jurisdictions include those with systemic human rights violations, as determined by the Trust Factory’s Human Rights Committee (e.g., based on UN Human Rights Council reports).

**Legal Structure:**
Regional entities may adopt cooperative, non-profit, or hybrid structures, depending on local laws, but must align with Trust Factory’s democratic and ethical principles.
Example: In the EU, a European Cooperative Society (SCE) could be used for cross-border operations.


**Operational Standards:**
Fair compensation: Employees and contributors must be paid equitably, with wages benchmarked against local living standards and tied to contributions to humanity (e.g., civic tech development, community projects).
Socioeconomic participation: Programs to ensure marginalized groups (e.g., low-income communities, youth) have access to digital tools and decision-making processes.
Transparency: Regular audits and public reporting on human rights compliance and financials.

**Licensing Agreement with Trust Factory:**
Regional entities operate under a standardized agreement that mandates adherence to Trust Factory’s human rights charter and operational guidelines.
Trust Factory retains oversight to revoke licenses if regional entities fail to meet human rights or ethical standards.

### Scaling the Network

- **Phase 1:** Pilot Entities: Establish Web Civics entities in 2–3 jurisdictions with strong human rights records (e.g., Canada, Netherlands, New Zealand) to test the model.
- **Phase 2:** Expansion: Scale to additional jurisdictions, prioritizing those with existing digital infrastructure and cooperative-friendly laws.
- **Technology Platform:** Develop a centralized digital platform (managed by Trust Factory) for network coordination, knowledge sharing, and monitoring compliance with human rights and participation goals.

3. Operational Infrastructure for Socioeconomic Participation

**Principles**

- **Fair Compensation:** Compensation must reflect contributions to societal good, not exploitation. For example, developers of civic tech tools should earn wages comparable to private-sector equivalents in their region.
- **Inclusivity:** Programs to engage underrepresented groups, such as digital literacy initiatives or participatory budgeting platforms.
- **Sustainability:** Revenue from services (e.g., civic tech solutions, consulting) reinvested into the network to fund expansion and innovation.

### Implementation

**Digital Infrastructure:**
Build a secure, open-source platform for Web Civics entities to collaborate, share resources, and track project impact.
Use blockchain or similar technologies for transparent tracking of contributions and compensation (if feasible within FINMA regulations).

**Funding Mechanisms:**
Seek grants from governments, foundations, or international organizations (e.g., UN agencies in Geneva) for initial funding.
Explore challenge grants tied to membership growth or project milestones (e.g., increasing digital inclusion in a region by 10%).
Develop revenue streams through ethical commercial activities, such as licensing civic tech solutions to governments or NGOs.

**Human Rights Monitoring:**
Partner with Geneva-based organizations (e.g., OHCHR, Geneva Academy) to develop metrics for assessing human rights compliance in regional entities.
Implement annual audits by independent third parties to ensure adherence to human rights standards.

4. Legal and Ethical Safeguards

- **Human Rights Charter:** A binding document for all entities, outlining commitments to freedom of expression, privacy, non-discrimination, and socioeconomic equity.
- **Exit Mechanisms:** Clauses allowing Trust Factory to dissolve or exit partnerships with regional entities that violate human rights or ethical standards.
- **Dispute Resolution:** Adopt the Swiss Arbitration Centre’s rules for international arbitration to resolve conflicts within the network, ensuring neutrality and fairness.
- **Data Protection:** Comply with Swiss data protection laws (nLPD) and GDPR for EU entities, ensuring user privacy in digital civic platforms.

5. Next Steps

- **Legal Consultation:** Engage a Swiss lawyer specializing in cooperative law to draft the Trust Factory articles of association (estimated cost: CHF 5,000–10,000).
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Convene a workshop in Geneva with NGOs, UN agencies, and cooperative experts to refine the model.
- **Pilot Launch:** Incorporate Trust Factory in Geneva and establish the first Web Civics entity in a cooperative-friendly jurisdiction (e.g., Netherlands) within 12–18 months.
- **Funding Strategy:** Apply for grants from Geneva-based organizations (e.g., UNEP, Global Fund) and explore partnerships with Swiss NGOs like Helvetas or Caritas.

Notes

The Latin phrase "cīvicus in terra et interreti" (citizen on earth and on the internet) can be incorporated into Trust Factory’s mission statement to symbolize its dual focus on physical and digital civic engagement.

Geneva’s high cost of living may pose challenges for establishing operations; consider leveraging Swiss government support for NGOs to offset costs.
Continuous engagement with International Geneva’s ecosystem (e.g., UNOG, ICRC) will enhance credibility and networking opportunities.
