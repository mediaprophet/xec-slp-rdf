# International Structure for Web Civics Incorporation

## Overview
Web Civics was born in 2014 as an initiative that was intended to produce software and support community engagement for cooperative and collaborative information communications technology (ICT) works, on a civics basis, for the betterment of humanity and as to support and seek to improve protection of, human rights. Trust Factory was born in 2015 as a consequence of works on 'identity credentials', 'verifiable claims' and related complex & sensitive web-standards and knowledge banking related works.  These efforts are related to the underlying works that led to international 'digital identity' outcomes; although, not entirely as was intended.  The broad-ranging ecosystems designs are intended to be 'human centric', or in cases where the term may not be clear enough; as may otherwise be defined as a pursuit to support Humanitarian ICT.

It has proven impossible to better advance these works in Australia, despite best efforts.  As such, efforts are now underway to look for the best juristiction to support the advancement of these very important works.  

The Web Civics ecosystem, is thought best established by being centered around a/the 'Trust Factory'. It is speculated that this may be best established as a Swiss cooperative in Geneva, thereafter adopting a governance structure inspired by the Governance structure of the City of London, to deliver humanitarian ICT and human rights infrastructure online & inter-juristictionally. This structure traditionally emphasizes stakeholder representation through guilds and/or livery companies, localized input via ward councils, and layered decision-making to ensure equitable participation, fair compensation, and alignment with human rights principles, including freedom of thought and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Whilst some modernisation is considered necessary, the intended purpose of the structure is intended to be designed to scale globally while maintaining ethical integrity and operational adaptability, with particular regard to the novel challenges brought about by 'digital transformation'.

## Terms

Note: Nomenclature is sought to be adjusted in future.  I amo not confident the best terms have been found yet, whilst, the general notion is hoped to be comprehensible in the meantime.

- **Guild(s):** an association of people for mutual aid or the pursuit of a common goal.
- **Ward(s):** an administrative division. A guard with the responsibility to protect. 
- **SDG(s):** The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations members in 2015, created 17 world Sustainable Development Goals. The aim of these global goals is "peace and prosperity for people and the planet" – while tackling climate change and working to preserve oceans and forests.
- **Civics:** study and works by natural persons to support the rights and duties of citizenship.


## Core Principles

- **Human Centric**: The purpose of the 'body of people' (corpus) is to produce both ICT related outcomes and ICT enabled outcomes, to promote human dignity, rights and the means for persons to be best equipped to protect their human rights.

- **Stakeholder Representation**: Stakeholder guilds (representing contributors, NGOs, regional entities, and communities) participate in the governance of the group entities that represent them, which in-turn is represented by the group entity to the broader community, ensuring diverse input into governance.

- **Layered Governance**: Decision-making is distributed across a Governing Council, Advisory Senate, and operational boards, whereby modelling is to be inspired by the City’s Court of Common Council and Court of Aldermen.

- **Ceremonial and Strategic Leadership**: A Chief Representative Officer (CRO) provides vision and advocacy, akin to the Lord Mayor, while operational leadership and advocacy for specialised fields is decentralized.

- **Ward-Based Input**: Regional or project-based ward councils channel grassroots feedback, ensuring local relevance and inclusivity.

- **Human Rights and Fairness**: All activities prioritize human rights (e.g., UDHR, ICCPR), freedom of thought via thoughtware infrastructure, and fair compensation tied to contributions to humanity, not perpetual royalties.

- **Sustainability and SDGs**: Revenue is reinvested to advance digital transformation, engagement, and advancement of projects that promote delivery of SDGs, with a focus on peace and humanitarian outcomes.

## 1. Central Entity: Trust Factory (Swiss Cooperative)

In-order to establish and foster development, administration and the means through which complex matters may be addressed, it is considered that a 'trust factory' is required.  The notion of a 'trust factory' is moreover about, the people. The employed concept of 'trust' relates to both,

- Being able to characterise the nature of the agent, entity and/or thing.
- Supporting the development of methodologies that provide reliable inferencing.

### Why a Swiss Cooperative?

- **Legal Framework**: Switzerland’s cooperative law (Articles 828–926, Swiss Code of Obligations) supports member-owned, democratic entities, ideal for balancing economic and humanitarian goals.

- **Geneva’s Advantages**: Geneva’s ecosystem, hosting over 40 international organizations and 750 NGOs, supports human rights advocacy and global coordination.
