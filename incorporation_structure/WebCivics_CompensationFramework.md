# Compensation Framework for Web Civics Ecosystem

## Overview
This framework outlines a compensation model for the Web Civics ecosystem, managed by the Trust Factory (Swiss cooperative in Geneva), to ensure fair remuneration for contributors’ useful work, particularly those who have historically worked without compensation to advance human rights. Drawing inspiration from the “git” contribution model, the framework prioritizes equitable compensation, recognition of moral and intellectual property (IP) rights, and alignment with human rights principles, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). It accommodates diverse revenue streams, regional variations, and IP rights transfer upon honorable claims, while ensuring inclusivity and sustainability.

## Core Principles
- **Fair Compensation**: Contributors are remunerated based on the societal value of their work, benchmarked against local living standards and market rates for comparable roles (e.g., civic tech development).
- **Recognition of Historical Contributions**: Individuals with uncompensated prior work (e.g., civic tech, human rights advocacy) can claim fair compensation for moral and IP rights, with IP rights transferred to the Trust Factory upon honorable claim validation to support the ecosystem’s mission.
- **Inclusivity**: Compensation structures prioritize access for marginalized groups, ensuring no one is excluded due to poverty or socioeconomic status.
- **Ontological Approach**: Compensation terms are defined using an ontology-based framework, accounting for regional cost-of-living differences, type of work, and contributions to humanity.
- **Civics Focus**: Compensation supports “civics” work—voluntary contributions by citizens to address unsolved community or human rights challenges, distinct from “civic” (government-mandated) activities.
- **Sustainability**: Revenue from diverse sources (e.g., grants, micropayments, corporate contributions) is reinvested to support the ecosystem and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## 1. Compensation Model
### 1.1 Fair Compensation Principles
- **Benchmarking**: Wages are tied to local living standards and market rates for similar roles (e.g., software developers, human rights advocates), ensuring equitable pay across jurisdictions.
- **Compensatory Multiplier**: For uncompensated historical work or high-impact contributions, a multiplier (2x–10x) may be applied to “fair value” based on:
  - **Type of Work**: Complexity and societal impact (e.g., developing open-source civic tech vs. administrative tasks).
  - **Time Invested**: Hours or years dedicated, verified through documentation or community attestation.
  - **Regional Factors**: Pricing power parity (PPP) calculations to adjust for local cost of living.
  - **Contribution to Humanity**: Alignment with human rights or SDGs (e.g., digital inclusion, freedom of thought infrastructure).
- **Moral and IP Rights**: Contributors retain moral rights to their work, but upon submitting an honorable claim for compensation, IP rights are transferred to the Trust Factory to support the ecosystem’s open-source and human rights objectives, with fair compensation provided.

### 1.2 Compensation for Historical Contributions
- **Eligibility**: Individuals or groups who have performed uncompensated “civics” work (e.g., open-source software, human rights advocacy) can submit claims to the Trust Factory.
- **Claims Process**:
  1. **Submission**: Contributors provide evidence (e.g., git repositories, project documentation, community endorsements) via the Web Civics digital platform, declaring the claim is made honorably.
  2. **Validation**: The Trust Factory’s Compensation Committee (a subset of the Advisory Senate) reviews claims, assessing impact, alignment with human rights principles, and the honorable nature of the claim.
  3. **IP Transfer and Compensation**: Upon validation, IP rights are transferred to the Trust Factory to ensure the work supports the ecosystem’s mission (e.g., open-source civic tech). Compensation is calculated using the compensatory multiplier, paid as lump sums or recurring payments, depending on the contributor’s preference and project needs.
- **Safeguards**: Claims are audited to prevent fraud, with disputes resolved via online arbitration (e.g., WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center). The honorable nature of claims is upheld through transparency and community verification.

### 1.3 Ongoing Contributions
- **Git-Inspired Model**: Contributors to Web Civics projects (e.g., civic tech, thoughtware) are compensated similarly to open-source contributors on platforms like GitHub, without requiring formal employment contracts.
- **Project-Based Compensation**:
  - Regional Web Civics entities manage project-specific budgets, allocating funds based on contributor roles and impact.
  - Compensation is tied to milestones or deliverables (e.g., code commits, community engagement programs).
- **Transparency**: Contribution records (e.g., commits, hours logged) are tracked on a blockchain-based or open-source platform to ensure fairness and auditability.

## 2. Revenue Streams
### 2.1 Diverse Funding Sources
- **Lump Sum Payments**:
  - **Grants**: From Geneva-based organizations (e.g., UNEP, Global Fund) or international NGOs (e.g., Helvetas, Caritas).
  - **Sponsorships and Bounties**: Corporate or institutional contributions for specific projects (e.g., digital literacy platforms).
  - **Challenge Grants**: Tied to measurable outcomes, such as increasing digital inclusion by 10% in a region.
- **Micropayments**:
  - Small, voluntary contributions from users or organizations, adjusted based on economic capacity (e.g., higher rates for corporations, free for low-income users).
  - Enabled through a digital payment system on the Web Civics platform, supporting multiple currencies or cryptocurrencies (if compliant with FINMA regulations).
- **Ethical Commercial Activities**:
  - Licensing civic tech solutions (e.g., participatory budgeting platforms) to governments or NGOs.
  - Consulting services for digital transformation or human rights compliance.

### 2.2 Ontological Revenue Allocation
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Revenue is distributed using an ontology-based system that considers:
  - **Agent Characteristics**: Economic status, location, and contribution type (e.g., individual vs. corporate).
  - **Project Needs**: Prioritize funding for high-impact projects (e.g., thoughtware for freedom of thought).
  - **Regional Adjustments**: Account for PPP to ensure equitable distribution across jurisdictions.
- **Reinvestment**: At least 70% of revenue is reinvested into the ecosystem to fund new projects, contributor compensation, and SDG-aligned initiatives.

## 3. Regional Implementation
- **Role of Regional Entities**:
  - Manage local projects and compensation budgets, adhering to Trust Factory’s fair compensation guidelines, including IP transfer protocols.
  - Adapt compensation multipliers to local economic conditions (e.g., higher multipliers in high-cost regions like Geneva).
  - Implement inclusivity programs to engage marginalized groups (e.g., digital literacy for low-income communities).
- **Oversight by Trust Factory**:
  - The Compensation Committee monitors regional compliance with fair compensation and IP transfer standards.
  - Regional entities submit annual reports on compensation practices and IP transfers, audited by independent third parties.
- **Licensing Agreements**:
  - Mandate adherence to the compensation framework and IP transfer policies in all regional partnerships.
  - Allow Trust Factory to revoke licenses for entities failing to meet fair compensation, IP transfer, or human rights standards.

## 4. Ontological Compensation Framework
### 4.1 Ontology Design
- **Entities**: Contributors, projects, jurisdictions, human rights principles, IP rights.
- **Relationships**: Map contributions to societal impact, linking to compensation rates, revenue sources, and IP transfer agreements.
- **Attributes**: Include work type, time invested, regional cost of living, SDG alignment, and IP ownership status.
- **Rules**:
  - Prioritize compensation for uncompensated historical work, with IP rights transferred to Trust Factory upon honorable claim validation.
  - Adjust payments based on PPP and local market rates.
  - Ensure inclusivity by waiving micropayments for low-income contributors.
