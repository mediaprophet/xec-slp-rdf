# International Structure for Web Civics Incorporation

## Overview
The Web Civics ecosystem, centered around the Trust Factory (a Swiss cooperative in Geneva), adopts a governance structure inspired by the City of London to deliver humanitarian ICT and human rights infrastructure. This structure emphasizes stakeholder representation through guilds (akin to livery companies), localized input via ward councils, and layered decision-making to ensure equitable participation, fair compensation, and alignment with human rights principles, including freedom of thought and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The structure is designed to scale globally while maintaining ethical integrity and operational adaptability.

## Core Principles

- **Stakeholder Representation**: Stakeholder guilds (representing contributors, NGOs, regional entities, and communities) mirror the City of London’s livery companies, ensuring diverse input into governance.

- **Layered Governance**: Decision-making is distributed across a Governing Council, Advisory Senate, and operational boards, inspired by the City’s Court of Common Council and Court of Aldermen.

- **Ceremonial and Strategic Leadership**: A Chief Representative Officer (CRO) provides vision and advocacy, akin to the Lord Mayor, while operational leadership is decentralized.

- **Ward-Based Input**: Regional or project-based ward councils channel grassroots feedback, ensuring local relevance and inclusivity.

- **Human Rights and Fairness**: All activities prioritize human rights (e.g., UDHR, ICCPR), freedom of thought via thoughtware infrastructure, and fair compensation tied to contributions to humanity, not perpetual royalties.

- **Sustainability and SDGs**: Revenue is reinvested to advance digital transformation, civic engagement, and SDGs, with a focus on peace and humanitarian outcomes.

## 1. Central Entity: Trust Factory (Swiss Cooperative)

### Why a Swiss Cooperative?

- **Legal Framework**: Switzerland’s cooperative law (Articles 828–926, Swiss Code of Obligations) supports member-owned, democratic entities, ideal for balancing economic and humanitarian goals.

- **Geneva’s Advantages**: Geneva’s ecosystem, hosting over 40 international organizations and 750 NGOs, supports human rights advocacy and global coordination.

- **Tax and Regulatory Benefits**: Cooperatives enjoy favorable tax treatment for non-profit activities, and Geneva’s infrastructure facilitates international operations.

### Incorporation Steps

   - Governance: One member, one vote; layered structure with a Governing Council, Advisory Senate, and stakeholder guilds; virtual/hybrid meetings for global accessibility.
   - Human Rights Charter: Mandates advocacy for human rights, fair compensation, and exit from jurisdictions/partnerships violating ethical standards.

2. **Register with Commercial Register**: File with the Geneva Commercial Register (fees: CHF 600–1,000).

3. **Capital Requirements**: Nominal member contributions (e.g., CHF 100–1,000) to ensure accessibility; economic benefits tied to participation, not capital.

4. **Compliance**: Register for VAT if turnover exceeds CHF 100,000; comply with FINMA for financial activities (e.g., trust management).
