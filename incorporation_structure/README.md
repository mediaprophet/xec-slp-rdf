# NOTES

In-order to rapidly produce documents, rather than pulling the older texts produced over the years (some are more than 15 years old) i've elected to more simply work with GROK to figure it out more quickly.

This in-turn produces 'boilerplate' content that can then be updated and modified.  iT is not expected to be the 'end-text'.
