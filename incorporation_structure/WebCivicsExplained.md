# Web Civics vs. Civic in the Context of Global Digital Transformation

## Web Civics: Citizen-Driven Digital Engagement for a Global Commonwealth

Inspired by the principles of civics, **Web Civics** refers to the study and actions by individual citizens worldwide, often through **social entrepreneurship**, to engage in works that act to support their means to foster knowledge, uphold their rights and duties in the global digital realm, independent of government or public sector involvement. It embodies and promotes, through useful works, the ideals of a "fair go," equality before the law, respect, tolerance, and a voice for all. 

## Foundational Assumptions

The foundational assumption that emboides the broad nature of these works, is that people are interested in, and willing to, do works that is good for others - without necessarily being provided a mandate by others to do so; whether, by employment or otherwise.  In-Effect, there's alot that people can do, to help others, to improve community circumstances, to provide practical contributions that are valued by others; yet, most often - particularly in relation to online works - this is expected to be done - at their own expense.  

These structures, the purpose of Web Civics, is to provide a means to both encourage people to learn how to do good things, albeit in a particular way, for humanity, for community for themselves & others; whilst also, being offered a means to potentially be paid fairly for useful works.

Web Civics focuses on:

- **Learning and Advocacy**: Understanding the means to produce, make available and use ICT that supports  rights (e.g., privacy, personhood, human agency, commons knowledge and resources) and advocating for awareness of solutions that can be adopted by global policy professionals whilst seeking to ensure no one feels voiceless, isolated or ignored.

- **Socially Entrepreneurial Contributions**: Using entrepreneurial principles to address social challenges, via means that particularly employ specific forms of 'digital transformation' related works; such as developing software, ontologies, documentation and the production of community-driven tools to foster inclusion and combat isolation, exclusion, exploitation and breaches to human rights that may otherwise be left without available lawful remedy or acknowledgement.

- **Ontologies and Knowledge Age Systems Engineering**: Contributing to ontologies (structured frameworks for organizing digital information), such as open data ecosystems or interoperable systems, to support a global digital commonwealth where diverse voices and stories feed into a shared  history.

Web Civics emphasizes individual and collective agency to create a democratic, inclusive societies where men, women, and children of all backgrounds can enjoy freedom, pursue ambitions, and have justice, agency, respect and inalienable supports for the right to self-determination and human dignity. 

It ensures that no one is made hopeless, ignored, or alone as a consequence of 'digital transformation' influences by providing novel avenues to make voices heard, support cooperation, collaboration on works supported by defined, 'fair terms'; fostering trust, respect, and collaboration via ICT Ecosystems.

## Civic: Public Sector Digital Infrastructure

**Civic** describes activities, systems, or structures tied to government-led or public sector initiatives, typically involving public sector workers. 

It includes:

- **Public Digital Infrastructure**: Government-developed platforms, such as e-governance portals, public APIs, or national 'digital identity' systems, that are most often operated by Government.

- **Civic Tech**: Technology projects funded or managed by public institutions, like city apps for reporting issues or public data dashboards.  

- **Digital Services**: Public sector-driven services, such as government-managed broadband networks or digital voting systems.

- **Ontologies in Governance**: Government-led efforts to create standardized data frameworks for public use, like taxonomies for open government data.

- **Examples**: A national government deploying a civic app for public services or an international agency developing an ontology for global health data.

***NOTE:*** The production of these tools may be done as a 'web civics' project, whilst the outcome may be that the derivatives end-up being handed-over to public sector entities for continued operation, management and maintenance. 

Civic focuses on the institutional and infrastructural aspects of digital transformation, often executed by or in collaboration with public sector entities, and may not inherently prioritize social entrepreneurship unless designed for social impact.  Often, public infrastructure is developed or acquired through tenders and other complex contractual arrangements, which often better suits large organisations domestic or abroad.

However, there is often not significant legal impediments to supporting the means for natural people, citizens, of one or more juristictions, to decide collaboratively or cooperatively that there is something that is worth creating - as is otherwise the case for commercial ventures generally.  Should these projects, as 'web civics' projects become successful, then where appropriate they may end-up being operated by government; even though, government was not the initiator nor inventor or creator of those initial works.

A problem that Web Civics is seeking to address, is that it is often the case that the question of compensating people who do those works in the interests of community, is set-aside by public sector actors.  This not-only disaffects those who are subject to such policy related terms, but also acts to reduce taxation and increase public sector liabilities, in a range of ways (some easier to understand than others).

## Key Distinction

- **Web Civics**: Citizen-initiated, socially entrepreneurial efforts to address global digital challenges and create a fair, inclusive digital commonwealth where all voices are heard (e.g., open-source tools, digital rights advocacy), reflecting the Australian ideals of equality, freedom, and a voice for all.

- **Civic**: Government or public sector-led digital initiatives and infrastructure (e.g., e-governance platforms, public APIs), typically managed by public sector workers.
