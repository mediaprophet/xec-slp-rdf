# xec-slp-rdf
Experimental work, looking at how to address the economic challenges associated with Humanitarian ICT work.

## What's the Problem?
The problem is that the economic architectures for doing useful work for the benefit of civil societies, human rights, purposes that are not merely commercial nor necessarily an area of interest of public entiteis (ie: government); is presently punitive.  Whilst the means to address these problem is non-trivial, and the amount of resources required to do so properly is also non-trivial; the notion that 'free workers' or 'free work' should magically solve the problem, is arguably a known lie.

very little is done to consider the implications. 

### Advancing a solution of some kind.
It is believed that there will likely be many aspects to these works that will be imperfect.  One of the most obvious areas of friction may well be, that i've selected eCash (XEC) or Bitcoin-ABC - specifically.  I think the reality is that there needs to be a choice that's made, in this case, i've gone with Bitcoin-ABC.  Couple reasons for that...  

**It appears to;**
1. Be an advancement of BitCoin specifically, alongside what appears to be related work.  
2. Lack a nation-state jurisdictional controller of the protocol. Therefore better as an 'internet protocol'... 
3. Its advanced a 'blended' method, providing security via 'proof of work', whilst enabling low-cost, rapid transactions via 'avalanche'. This enables micro-payments.
4. There's been a number of changes, including the structure of the domination to harmonize with other systems that expect 2 decimal places (not 8). 
5. It seems likely, that its a good innovation choice - both, because the value of the currency may rise dramatically if ecosystems are made to work; and, that its relatively small scale presently - so bigger choices, might be more easily made...
6. Its MIT licensed.

**Things i'd like to address;**
7. It would be good to have a protocol that's evaluating the energy consumption of transactions, nodes, the network, etc.  this could include source of energy - but would evolve.  
8. There's a question about quantum secure cryptography, how that's able to be addressed & what the implications might then be. 
9. Historically, wallet addresses are issued to legal entities.  This often means people have only 1 or perhaps a few addresses.  I think this could change to a model where people have alot of addresses.
10. Multi-Sig wallets (ie: requiring multiple people to approve a transaction) isn't easily demonstrated yet.  

***Future - Multi-Protocol Support***
The project intends to end-up with support for multiple protocols, this is an important safety measure for humanitarian scale blockchain technology. Yet, the development is intended to be on XEC until further notice.  It is hoped, this works out, and in-turn, the protocol will create historic outcomes for the benefit of humanity...  whilst, others are still thereafter, made compatible. 

### Things I'm interested in developing
SLP tokens can or could use [IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System) document locations that are then attached to the SLP token. It is believed that this can then be used to store RDF data (structured data) to support a range of different use-cases... 

## NOTE ON ENERGY
Consideration needs to be made about energy.  It seems appropriate to ensure the floor-price of a transaction, has a useful value that is greater than the cost of the energy to make it.
