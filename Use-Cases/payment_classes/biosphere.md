# Biosphere

There are many types of non-financial currencies that are related to the biosphere or the natural environment. Some examples might include:

- **Water credits:** Water credits are a type of non-financial currency that can be bought and sold as a way to incentivize the efficient use of water resources. Water credits may be used to allocate water rights or to offset water use in different regions or sectors.

- **Biodiversity credits:** Biodiversity credits are a type of non-financial currency that can be bought and sold as a way to incentivize the conservation of biodiversity and the protection of ecosystems. Biodiversity credits may be used to offset the impact of development projects or to reward the implementation of conservation measures.

- **Carbon offset credits:** Carbon offset credits are a type of non-financial currency that can be bought and sold as a way to offset carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon offset credits may be used to offset the carbon emissions of a specific project or activity by supporting the implementation of carbon reduction projects elsewhere.

- **Ecological credits:** Ecological credits are a type of non-financial currency that can be bought and sold as a way to incentivize the restoration and protection of ecosystems. Ecological credits may be used to offset the impact of development projects or to reward the implementation of conservation measures.

- **Nature credits:** Nature credits are a type of non-financial currency that can be bought and sold as a way to incentivize the conservation of natural resources and the protection of the environment. Nature credits may be used to offset the impact of development projects or to reward the implementation of conservation measures.

- **Eco-points:** Eco-points are a type of non-financial currency that can be earned through the adoption of environmentally-friendly behaviours or the use of eco-friendly products. Eco-points may be redeemable for a variety of goods and services or may be used to unlock special privileges or perks.

- **Green dollars:** Green dollars are a type of non-financial currency that is used within a specific community or region to promote local economic development and sustainability. Green dollars may be earned through the adoption of environmentally-friendly behaviours or the use of eco-friendly products and may be used to purchase goods and services within the community.

- **Renewable energy credits:** Renewable energy credits are a type of non-financial currency that can be bought and sold as a way to incentivize the adoption of renewable energy technologies. Renewable energy credits may be used to offset the use of non-renewable energy sources or to reward the generation of renewable energy.

- **Waste credits:** Waste credits are a type of non-financial currency that can be bought and sold as a way to incentivize the reduction of waste and the adoption of recycling and other waste management practices. Waste credits may be used to offset the generation of waste or to reward the implementation of waste reduction measures.

- **Green bonds**: Green bonds are a type of financial instrument that is used to raise capital for environmental projects or initiatives. Green bonds may be issued by governments, businesses, or other organisations and may be used to finance a variety of projects, such as renewable energy projects or conservation efforts.

- **Carbon offsets:** Carbon offsets are a type of non-financial currency that can be bought and sold as a way to offset carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon offsets may be used to offset the carbon emissions of a specific project or activity by supporting the implementation of carbon reduction projects elsewhere.

- **Eco-tokens:** Eco-tokens are a type of non-financial currency that is used to reward the adoption of environmentally-friendly behaviours or the use of eco-friendly products. Eco-tokens may be redeemable for a variety of goods and services or may be used to unlock special privileges or perks.

- **Carbon credits for soil carbon sequestration:** Carbon credits could be used to incentivize the adoption of practices that sequester carbon in soil, such as regenerative agriculture or agroforestry.

- **Water quality credits:** Water quality credits could be used to incentivize the improvement of water quality in lakes, rivers, and other water bodies.

- **Habitat credits:** Habitat credits could be used to incentivize the creation or restoration of habitat for endangered species or other wildlife.

- **Ecosystem services credits:** Ecosystem services credits could be used to incentivize the protection of natural systems that provide important benefits to humans, such as flood control, air purification, or pollination.

Within the sphere of ‘knowledge based currencies’, non-financial biosphere-related instruments can be useful to incentivize the conservation of natural resources and protection of our biosphere environment, as well as to promote the adoption of sustainable practices, through the use of technologies that provide a means to value it.
