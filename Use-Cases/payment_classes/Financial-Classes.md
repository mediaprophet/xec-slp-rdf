# Financial Classes

## General

1. **Micro Payments**: These are small payments that are typically made online and are used to purchase digital goods or services. They are often used for low-cost items or for items that are purchased frequently, such as online articles or music tracks.

   Micropayment systems are a critical component of how the requirements for various systems are going to be made able to work. However the design of these systems must consider various ESG factors \- which is part of what the intention of ensuring support for micropayments does innately; but that also, the Biosphere Ontologies and in-particular Energy Calcs become critically important. 

   The way through which micropayment mechanisms are made able to work, must end-up costing less than the amount of the payment.

2. **Gifts And Donations**: These are payments that are made without the expectation of receiving something in return. Gifts are typically given to show affection or appreciation, while donations are often made to support a particular cause or organisation.
