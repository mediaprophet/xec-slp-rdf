# Non-Financial 

*(Knowledge Economy ‘Currencies’)*

There are many types of non-financial currencies that can be used in place of traditional financial currencies, such as dollars, euros, or pounds. Non-financial currencies can take a variety of forms and can be used for a variety of purposes.

It is worth noting that non-financial currencies can be used in a variety of ways and can have a variety of benefits. For example, non-financial currencies may:

* Provide an alternative means of exchange in situations where traditional financial currencies are not available or are not practical.

* Encourage local economic development and community building by promoting trade within a specific community or region.

* Foster loyalty and reward customer behaviour.

* Create new opportunities for innovation and experimentation with different forms of value exchange.

Traditionally; non-financial currencies have also had an array of limitations and challenges.

For example:

* Be subject to fraud or abuse.

* Be difficult to track and audit.

* Be subject to volatility and fluctuation in value.

* Be subject to regulation and oversight by governments or other authorities.

As such, whilst non-financial currencies can be a useful and innovative way to exchange value and facilitate transactions, it is important to carefully consider the potential benefits and challenges before implementing them. One of the more significant recent examples is Carbon Credits.  Carbon credits are a type of non-financial currency that can be bought and sold as a way to offset carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon credits are used as a way to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and to promote the adoption of clean energy technologies.

Under a carbon credit system, a government or other authority sets a cap on the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted within a specific region or sector. Companies or other organisations that exceed their allocated carbon emissions are required to purchase carbon credits from those that have emitted less than their allocated amount. This creates a market for carbon credits, with the goal of reducing overall carbon dioxide emissions and incentivizing the adoption of clean energy technologies.

Carbon credits can be bought and sold on carbon markets, such as the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) or the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX). The value of carbon credits is typically based on the cost of reducing or offsetting a ton of carbon dioxide emissions.

Overall, carbon credits are a way to use market forces to encourage the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the adoption of clean energy technologies.
