# Contribution Classifications

There is a need to create categories in relation to the types of contributions made. Some may be as simple as a small change, that takes a few seconds; others, may represent on-going works over a long-period of time; that has involved great sacrifice & attention. 

In some cases also; contributions may be specifically requested; whilst others, may just be an idea or something that someone thought was a ‘good idea’, and they just did it.   The means to create formula around how to address the characteristics of any, requires the framework to be defined; here are some initial thoughts,

1. **Necessary contributions:** These are contributions that are identified as necessary for the successful completion of a project. They may involve tasks or responsibilities that are specifically assigned to individuals or that are essential for the project to move forward.

2. **Unsolicited contributions:** These are contributions that are made by individuals without being specifically requested or assigned. They may be undertaken on a volunteer basis or as part of an individual's personal interest in the project.

3. **Valued contributions:** These are contributions that are considered to be particularly valuable or beneficial to the project. They may be identified through feedback or evaluation processes, or through other means of assessment.

4. **Collaborative contributions:** These are contributions that involve collaboration or teamwork with others. They may involve the exchange of ideas, the sharing of resources or expertise, or other forms of collaboration.

5. **Time-limited contributions:** These are contributions that are made on a temporary or short-term basis. They may involve tasks or responsibilities that are specific to a particular phase or stage of the project, or that are completed within a specific timeframe.

6. **Ongoing contributions:** These are contributions that are made on a more long-term or ongoing basis. They may involve tasks or responsibilities that are ongoing or that are expected to continue over a longer period of time.

7. **Discrete contributions:** These are contributions that are self-contained or that can be completed independently of other contributions. They may involve tasks or responsibilities that are discrete or that can be completed on a standalone basis.

8. **Interdependent contributions:** These are contributions that are dependent on or interconnected with other contributions. They may involve tasks or responsibilities that rely on the work of others in order to be completed or that are part of a larger system or process.

9. **Different types of work:** This classification could involve subcategories for different types of tasks or responsibilities, such as design work, research, programming, testing, etc.

10. **Contributions of resources or equipment and supplies:** This classification could involve subcategories for different types of resources or supplies that are contributed to the project, such as software, hardware, data, etc.

11. **Contributions of intellectual property:** This classification could involve subcategories for different types of intellectual property contributions, such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, etc.

12. **Contributions on defined terms:** This classification could involve subcategories for contributions that are made on specific terms or conditions, such as contributions made under a particular licence or agreement.

13. **Expertise-based contributions:** This classification could involve subcategories for contributions that are based on specific expertise or skills, such as contributions of knowledge or expertise in a particular field or domain.

14. **Role-based contributions:** This classification could involve subcategories for contributions that are related to specific roles or responsibilities, such as contributions made by project managers, team leaders, or other key stakeholders.

15. **Collaborative contributions:** This classification could involve subcategories for contributions that involve collaboration or teamwork with others, such as contributions that involve the exchange of ideas or the sharing of resources or expertise.

16. **Standalone contributions:** This classification could involve subcategories for contributions that are self-contained or that can be completed independently of other contributions, such as contributions that are discrete or that can be completed on a standalone basis.
