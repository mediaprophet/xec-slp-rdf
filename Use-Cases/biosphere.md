Biodiversity credits may be used to offset the impact of development projects or to reward the implementation of conservation measures.

69. **Carbon offset credits:** Carbon offset credits are a type of non-financial currency that can be bought and sold as a way to offset carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon offset credits may be used to offset the carbon emissions of a specific project or activity by supporting the implementation of carbon reduction projects elsewhere.

70. **Ecological credits:** Ecological credits are a type of non-financial currency that can be bought and sold as a way to incentivize the restoration and protection of ecosystems.

71. **Nature credits:** Nature credits are a type of non-financial currency that can be bought and sold as a way to incentivize the conservation of natural resources and the protection of the environment. Nature credits may be used to offset the impact of development projects or to reward the implementation of conservation measures.

72. **Eco-points:** Eco-points are a type of non-financial currency that can be earned through the adoption of environmentally-friendly behaviours or the use of eco-friendly products.

74. **Renewable energy credits:** Renewable energy credits are a type of non-financial currency that can be bought and sold as a way to incentivize the adoption of renewable energy technologies. Renewable energy credits may be used to offset the use of non-renewable energy sources or to reward the generation of renewable energy.

75. **Waste credits:** Waste credits are a type of non-financial currency that can be bought and sold as a way to incentivize the reduction of waste and the adoption of recycling and other waste management practices.

81. **Habitat credits:** Habitat credits could be used to incentivize the creation or restoration of habitat for endangered species or other wildlife.

82. **Ecosystem services credits:** Ecosystem services credits could be used to incentivize the protection of natural systems that provide important benefits to humans, such as flood control, air purification, or pollination.

Within the sphere of ‘knowledge based currencies’, non-financial biosphere-related instruments can be useful to incentivize the conservation of natural resources and protection of our biosphere environment, as well as to promote the adoption of sustainable practices, through the use of technologies that provide a means to value it.
