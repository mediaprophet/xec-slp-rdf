# Ontological Currencies


This document will start with some basic ontology modelling for the purpose of then expanding it into broader spheres.  A transaction may be packaged, to incorporate multiple line-items, with a view to seeking to form a more coherent economic system and/or methodology, that should in-turn inspire and foster innovation.   

## Process
Thinking is, that the process will be about going through the past work defined / generated, then processing it as 'pass1', which will generate some initial RDF.  This will then be remodelled / reformatted through an additional pass (pass2).  Which is then ***hoped*** to result in the useful output as a consequence of a final pass (pass3). Additional processing will be undertaken as needed.
